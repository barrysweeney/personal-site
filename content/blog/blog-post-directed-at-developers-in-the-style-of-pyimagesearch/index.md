In this tutorial you will learn how to ...

You might be asking

> "Hi - How do we do X? Is it possible?"

Sure is, **just read on to find out**.

Looking for source code?

[Jump to downloads section ->](#)

## Repeat the heading again here

We'll do A in the first part.

Then we'll do B.

Then C.

We'll then wrap up with a discussion of our results

### How can X do Y?

![using x to do y comparison of the reuslts](folder-structure.png "using x to do y comparison of the reuslts")

We know that we can do A with X

The question then becomes

> "How can X do Y?"

The answer is that we use a function know as a XYZ function

This XYZ function has output 0 to 1 as shown in th eabove figure.

* DOing A gives a reading of 0.02
* DOing B gives a reading of 0.93

A good rule of thumb is to do D and if your result is less than 0.5 do H.

Practical use cases of gaving X do Y are:

* SIgnature verification
* Fraud detection
* Handwriting identification

## Configuring your devlopment environment

If you want to follow along to the tutorial you can take some time to setup your environment by installing X and Y on your system using either of these guides

* Install X and Y on Ubuntu
* Install X and Y on macOS

EIther will help you setup the required software for this tutorial in a conventient environment.

## Project Structure

Let's review our directory structure before we go any further. You can start by using the downloads section to get the source code and examples.

Now let's look at the project:

![folder sturucture](folder-structure.png)

Here's what's inside the examples directory

![image of examples](lorem-persona.png)

We'll use these examples to do X and Y

The python files

1. some.py

   our output for something
2. utils.py

   helper functions for math equations

The main.py

1. Imports X
2. Loads T from disk
3. Generates something
4. Creates basic something
5. Trains network
6. Serializes trained network to disk

For a full rundown of all the files you can see [this tutorial](#). The other files have been included in this tutorial for completeness.

The main file of todays tutorial, XtoY.py will

1. load model from disk
2. grab paths to sample data in examples directory
3. rank contrast points
4. output cisual network view

Let's get to work.
